Parse Image Uploader

Built an Image uploader initially using Backbone. Explored a different way to have global variables. We have intermediate "controller" object that orchestrates the creation and organization of views into a hierarchy. (App object found in app.js.)

The main focus was to explore the differences between Backbone and Parse being the Model constructor and Parse doesn't fire add events during a fetch().
